The main issue was whether Section 140, which deals with compensation for no-fault liability, can be applied retrospectively to accidents that occurred before the Act came into force.\n\nThe brief facts of the case are as follows: The Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal awarded the respondents compensation under Section 140 of the Act of 1988 for the death of a person resulting from a motor accident. An appeal was filed challenging the applicability of Section 140 to accidents that occurred before the Act came into force.\n\nThe learned single Judge referred the question of retrospective operation of Section 140 to the Full Bench for consideration. The Full Bench, comprising A.K. Mathur, C.J., Dipak Misra, J., and D. Dharmadhikari, J., heard the arguments and provided their opinion on the matter.\n\nThe Full Bench analyzed the relevant provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, including Section 140, Section 144 (which has an overriding effect), and Section 217 (which deals with repeal and savings). They also considered previous decisions on the issue.\n\nAfter examining the provisions and considering the arguments, the Full Bench concluded that Section 140 of the Act of 1988 does not have retrospective effect. They reasoned that Section 144, which gives overriding effect to Chapter X (including Section 140), does not imply retrospective application. They also emphasized that the grant of compensation is a matter of substantive law, and unless the legislature clearly intended retrospective application, it should be considered prospective.\n\nThe Full Bench referred to previous decisions of the Madhya Pradesh High Court and other courts, including the Full Bench decision in New India Assurance Company v. Nafis Begam, which held that Section 140 is prospective in nature. They also referred to two Full Bench decisions of the Kerala High Court that reached a similar conclusion.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2079, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a5984a07-5d79-45c8-83b6-846dd6ec9c1f": {"__data__": {"id_": "a5984a07-5d79-45c8-83b6-846dd6ec9c1f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"meta data": " This case discusses the procedure for applying for and granting permits under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 and the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.

The court had to decide whether to condone the delay and proceed with the appeal on its merits.\n\nDuring the hearing, both parties presented their arguments on the question of condoning the delay as well as the merit of the appeal itself. The appellant claimed that he had lost contact with his advocate due to shifting his business to a different location and was unaware of the disposal of the appeal by the single judge of the High Court. However, the counter affidavits filed on behalf of the respondent denied the appellant's claims.\n\nThe court noted that while the delay in filing the appeal was significant, there was no evidence to suggest that the appellant had deliberately delayed the matter. The court emphasized that the question of delay should be considered liberally in order to advance the cause of substantial justice. Refusing to condone the delay could result in a meritorious matter being dismissed at the outset and justice being defeated. The court referred to previous Supreme Court observations that a litigant does not benefit from delaying an appeal and that the judiciary is respected for its power to remove injustice, not legalize it on technical grounds.\n\nConsidering these factors, the court decided to condone the delay in filing the appeal, despite objections raised by the respondents. However, the court clarified that if the delay was condoned and the judgment of the single judge was modified, the Insurance Company would not be liable to pay interest for the relevant period. Instead, the appellant would be responsible for paying the interest to the claimant/second respondent.\n\nThe court then proceeded to discuss the merit of the appeal, which involved the extent of liability of the Insurance Company. The relevant facts were summarized, and the court referred to provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939, and the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, to determine the liability.\n\nUltimately, the court held that the liability of the Insurance Company should be determined based on the provisions of the new Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, which removed the previous limitations on liability. The court referred to a Supreme Court decision that supported this interpretation. Consequently, the court set aside the single judge's order, ruling that the Insurance Company was liable to pay the entire awarded amount, rather than being limited to Rs. 1,50,000 as stated by the single judge.\n\nRegarding interest, the court directed that the owner would be liable to pay interest on the differential amount from the date of the single judge's judgment until the date of the judgment in the present appeal. However, the Insurance Company would be liable to pay interest on the differential amount for the period after the single judge's judgment and prior to the judgment in the present appeal.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3139, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a9464f3b-3aa5-47dd-980b-55598d5bd078": {"__data__": {"id_": "a9464f3b-3aa5-47dd-980b-55598d5bd078", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"meta data": "This case examined whether machines such as Motor Grader, Vibratory Roller, Wheel Loader, Paver, Excavator-cum-loader, Crane etc. should be treated as motor vehicles under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, the Bombay Motor Vehicles Tax Act, 1958, and the Gujarat Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989.

The Court held that such a petition was maintainable, despite the existence of Section 173 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. The Court then proceeded to consider the rival contentions of the writ petitioner (insurer) and the respondents (claimants). The Court ruled that an insurer can challenge an award given by the Tribunal by filing a petition under Articles 226/227 of the Constitution, as the grounds of challenge are limited to those provided under Section 173 of the Act. The Court also held that the power of judicial review by the court in the exercise of its extraordinary jurisdiction under Articles 226/227 of the Constitution can be invoked and exercised in cases where the award is based on fraud and the insurance company has no remedy under the Motor Vehicles Act.\n"}}, "National Insurance Co.Ltd vs Chitra on 26 June, 2012\n": {"node_ids": ["d1670b0c-852b-48d6-8e63-0cd1cf9b6b18"], "metadata": {"meta data": "This case is about a claim petition filed by the father of a deceased accident victim, which was objected to by the appellant/National Insurance Company.
